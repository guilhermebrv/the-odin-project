	<p>"In the <em>Harry Potter series</em>, Harry's birthday cake is typically described as a traditional 
		sponge cake, often with chocolate or vanilla flavoring. The cake is typically decorated 
		with colorful icing or frosting, and may feature Harry's name or other decorations in icing 
		or fondant. In the first book, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," Hagrid brings 
		Harry a homemade cake with green icing and the words "Happy Birthday Harry" written in pink 
		icing. In subsequent books and movies, Harry's birthday cake may vary in appearance, but it 
		is always a festive and special treat to mark the occasion of his birthday."</p>
