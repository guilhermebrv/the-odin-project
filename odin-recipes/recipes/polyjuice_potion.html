	<p>"Polyjuice Potion is a potion that allows the drinker to temporarily transform into 
		another person. It is described as a thick, greenish-brown liquid that has a strong, 
		unpleasant taste. The potion is made by mixing the hair, fingernails, and a drop of 
		blood from the person you want to transform into with a potion. Once the potion is 
		consumed, the drinker will transform into the person whose DNA material was used 
		to make the potion."</p>
