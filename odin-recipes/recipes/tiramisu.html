		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian layered dessert with rum-flavored, 
		coffee-soaked ladyfingers, a creamy mascarpone custard, and whipped 
		cream. This tiramisu recipe is easy to make at home for an impressive 
		no-bake dessert.</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<h4>For the Cream:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>4 large egg yolks</li>
			<li>1/2 cup or 100 grams of granulated sugar</li>
			<li>3/4 cup of heavy cream</li>
			<li>1 cup or 227 grams of mascarpone cheese</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>For the Assembly:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1 3/4 cups of good expresso or very strong coffee</li>
			<li>2 tbps of rum or cognac</li>
			<li>2 tbps of unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
			<li>About 24 ladyfingers (200 grams package)</li>
			<li>1 to 2 ounces of bittersweet chocolate, for shaving (optional)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg yolks and ¼ cup/50 grams 
				sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall 
				from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Transfer mixture to a 
				large bowl, wiping out the medium bowl used to whip the yolks and set aside.</li>
			<li>In the medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until it creates 
				soft-medium peaks. Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable 
				mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks 
				until combined.</li>
			<li>Combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
			<li>Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an 8x8-inch dish, or a 9-inch round 
				cake pan would also work here) with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.</li>
			<li>Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture -- they are quite 
				porous and will fall apart if left in the liquid too long -- and place them rounded side up at 
				the bottom of the baking dish. Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until you’ve got an even layer, 
				breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in any obvious gaps (a little space in between 
				is O.K.). Spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even layer. Repeat with 
				remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.</li>
			<li>Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder. Top with shaved or finely grated chocolate, 
					if desired.</li>
			<li>Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (if you can wait 24 hours, 
				all the better) before slicing or scooping to serve.</li>
